## Dataset Notes
### Cadastral
This is actually a derived product, compiled by the VT Agency of Natural Resources as a one-time deal from 191 (out of 237) individual town datasets, last updated as indicated in the "year" field. This dataset is provided AS IS and will probably be out of date tomorrow. Parcels are not for the faint of heart . . .
